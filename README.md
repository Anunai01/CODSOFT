# STUDENT GRADE CALCULATOR
A student grade calculator in Java is a program designed to compute and display the grades of students based on their scores in various subjects. Here's a short summary of how it typically works:

Input: The program takes input for student details (such as name or ID) and their scores in different subjects. This input can be provided via a graphical user interface (GUI) or command line.

Processing: The program processes these scores to compute the total marks and average. It may also determine the grade based on predefined criteria (e.g., A for 90-100, B for 80-89, etc.).

Output: The program outputs the total marks, average, and grade for each student. It may also display the results in a user-friendly format through a GUI or simply print them to the console.


# GUESS THE NUMBER 
Guess the Number" is a classic number-guessing game often implemented in Java to practice basic programming concepts. Here is a short summary of how such a game might be structured in Java:

Game Setup: The game randomly selects a number within a specified range, typically between 1 and 100.

User Input: The user is prompted to guess the number. This input is usually taken via the console using a Scanner object.

Game Loop: A loop runs to check the user's guess against the target number:

If the guess is too high or too low, a hint is provided, and the user is prompted to guess again.
If the guess is correct, a congratulatory message is displayed, and the loop terminates.
Ending the Game: The game can provide the option to play again or exit after a successful guess.


# ATM STIMULATOR MACHINE
An ATM (Automated Teller Machine) simulator in Java typically involves simulating basic banking operations such as checking balance, depositing money, withdrawing money, and exiting the application. This simulation helps in understanding object-oriented programming concepts, user input handling, and control flow in Java.
